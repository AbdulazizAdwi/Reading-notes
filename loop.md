we can use logical elents  to make our code and put some condition to it



<u> little example </u> 


 


if(mohammed &gt; Ahmed){


  
    and here we write what we want to do 


 

}else if(){

    
 
    here we write another condition 
    
 
}else{

 
    
if nothing is correct do this 

 
}


##  loops 


for (var x = 0; x &lt; 10; x++){


 

document.write(here the code will be repeat 10 times );



}


foor loops or while loops these are tools 

 to help us to loop from the codes   


 and save some times 

 instead to write the code more and more 

 
     &#10; 

with one code of loops will do the job for you a good example  



<pre>

now imagin you are going to write a code for your website 

to get the user  date 

without loops you need to make 

a select items it is hold the years 

from 19970 

untill 2021

i think this is very hard and lost of time 

to write around 100000000 codes 

so for this loops made :)


a simple code from for loops will make the job for 


little example 


select

option 19970  /option
option 19971  /option
option 19972  /option
option 19973  /option
option 19974  /option
option 19975  /option
option 19976  /option
option 19977  /option
option 19978  /option
option 19979  /option
option 19980  /option
 
frind this is hard so lets try the loops 





select

first write the select list 

select 

for(x=0; x &lt; 19970; x++){

    option  x    / option 

}

and this will do the rest for you 



/select
