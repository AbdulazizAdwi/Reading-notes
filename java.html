<pre>
    A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
