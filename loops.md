we can use logical elments to make our code and put some condition to it little example
if(mohammed > Ahmed){
and here we write what we want to do
}else if(){
here we write another condition
}else{
if nothing is correct do this
}
loops
for (var x = 0; x < 10; x++){
document.write(here the code will be repeat 10 times ); } foor loops or while loops these are tools
to help us to loop from the codes
and save some times instead to write the code more and more
with one code of loops will do the job for you a good example


now imagin you are going to write a code for your website 
![GitHub Logo](https://lequid.es/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WHAT-IS-THE-CORPORATE-WEBSITE.jpg)

to get the user  date 

without loops you need to make 

a select items it is hold the years 

from 19970 

untill 2021

i think this is very hard and lost of time 

to write around 100000000 codes 

so for this loops made :)


a simple code from for loops will make the job for 


little example 


select

option 19970  /option
option 19971  /option
option 19972  /option
option 19973  /option
option 19974  /option
option 19975  /option
option 19976  /option
option 19977  /option
option 19978  /option
option 19979  /option
option 19980  /option
 
frind this is hard so lets try the loops 





select

first write the select list 

select 

for(x=0; x < 19970; x++){

    option  x    / option 

}

and this will do the rest for you 



/select
