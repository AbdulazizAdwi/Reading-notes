CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

Summary
INTRODUCING CSS
 

* X CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
* X Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
* X Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
* X Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* X CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.
